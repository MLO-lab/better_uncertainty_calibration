# Logits

The logits are pretrained from `https://github.com/markus93/NN_calibration/tree/master/logits` and `https://github.com/AmirooR/IntraOrderPreservingCalibration`.
For quality of life and backup redundancy, we also provide them in the following Google Drive link https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/10XVg_anBCWmjzjh_Hb-A7GYcgjHLypax?usp=sharing
